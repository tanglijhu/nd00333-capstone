    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.\n",
    "In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.\n",
    "This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.\n",

    "### **In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains the bank marketing data including age, job, marital status, education, housing, loan, poutcome, etc. It is a classification problem where the goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### **In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data preprocessing part, all the categorical (text) feature columns are encoded into numerical forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ML training part, the best performing model was Logistic Regression with the following metrics:\n",
    "- Regularization Strength: 0.2135\n",
    "- Max Iterations: 50\n",
    "- Accuracy: 0.911\n",

    "- The dataset used for training was obtained from Azure dataset using a provided url:\n",
    "- The dataset was then transformed to dataframe using pandas library, got cleaned by deleting any missing data if any, and hot edcoded columns. Finally, this dataframe was split into training and testing datasets.\n",
    "- The classification algorithm used in this study was Logistic Regression from sklearn. Logistis Regression is a go-to binary classification algorithm with the benifits of: 1) easier to use and interpret, 2) very efficient to train, 3) making no assumptions about distributions of classes in feature space. \n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning was performed by using HyperDriveConfig with specified regression training transcript and hyperparameters. As for Logistic Regression, C parameter controls the penality strength (i.e., inverse penlity so smaller value specifies more penality and strong regularization) and max_iter parameter means the maximum number of iterations taken for the solvers to converge. In this case, the search space for C parameter was uniformed distributed in 0.1 to 1 and for max_iter was chosen with discreate value as of 50, 100, 150, 200 (100 as default). "

    "The early stopping policy chosen here was banditPolicy, which is based on slack factor and evaluation interval. Bandit terminates runs where the primary metric is beyond the specified slack factor compared to the best performing run, therefore helping save the total training time. It is mainly used for aggressive saving with relatively large truncation percentage. \n",

    "\n",
    "LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework using tree based learning algorithms. It offers several advantages: 1) faster trainng speed with higher efficiency; 2) lower memory usage; 3) better accuracy; 4) support of parallel and GPU learning; and 5) capable of handling large-scale data. \n",

    "- SDK Hyperdrive hyperparameter tuning do need to specify detail information such as sampling method, early termination policy, primary metric name, primary metric goal, and some other hyperparameters. However, SDK Hyperdrive hyperparameter tuning process allows the user to control more details regarding the training algorithms and other details.\n",
    "- On the other hand, AutoML does not need to specify any detail parameters but generally two of them: task (regression, clarrification, forcasting) and primary metric. AutoML performs missing data checking, imbalance data, feature engineering and n_cross_validation and thus provides the user with corresponding recommendations. Therefore it does all the heavy-liftingjob under the hood and everything can be automated. In addition, one great benifit AutoML provides is the model expanation, which can be leveraged by the user to obtain insights for global feature importance."

    "PCA enables to represent a multivariate data (i.e., high dimension) as smaller set of variables (i.e., small dimenstion) in order to observe trends, clusters, and outliers. This could uncover the relationships between observations and variables and among the variables. \n",

    "- To fix data imbalance.\n",
    "The dataset is highly imbalanced and about 2473 / (2473 + 22076) * 100 = 10.1 % of the clients actually subscribed to a term deposit. Imbalanced data can lead to a falsely perceived positive effect of a model's accuracy because the input data has bias towards one class. Therefore, an data imbalance issue should be considered to fix for future experiments.We may try: 1) random undersampling, 2) oversampling with SMOTE, 3) a combination of under- and oversampling method using pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To try to use other metrics such as 'AUC_weighted' to get better training . \n",
    "As for a highly unbalanced problem like this, AUC metric is very popular. AUC is acturally preferred over accuracy for binary classification therefore this metric is worth a try. \n",
